# Mobile_Shopee_Ecommerce
This is a graphical user interface of a responsive E-Commerce Web application. 
I mainly used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap to make this GUI. I also used Owl-carousel to make a beautiful responsive carousel to make the GUI more attractive. 
I have attached a demo video below, please watch it to get amore clear idea about the GUI of the web application.

This demo video shows the beautiful Carousel and GUI of the website in Desktop mode
